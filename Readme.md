BIOL 522: Bioinformatics for NGS Data Analysis

Graduate Course offered every fall semester at the Natural Sciences Department of Elizabeth City State University (ECSU)

Course duration – 14 Weeks

Welcome to the course repository for BIOL 522: Bioinformatics for NGS Data Analysis.

This repository is under active development for Fall 2026. When it is completed, it will contain course materials, code examples, datasets (or links to them), and assignment instructions. Students will use this repository to access weekly materials, submit assignments, and manage their final projects.

📚 Course Overview

This course introduces computational methods for analyzing next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. Students will gain proficiency in:

• Linux/Unix command line for bioinformatics

• Shell scripting for automation

• Python scripting for data parsing and analysis

• High-performance computing (HPC) with ACCESS-CI \& SGX3

• NGS data workflows: quality control, trimming, alignment

• Reproducibility practices: version control, workflow managers, FAIR data principles

By the end of the course, students will be able to run reproducible NGS pipelines on HPC systems and manage their projects using GitHub.
