Setting up BIOL522-ngs repo
1. Clone the repository locally

Open a terminal (or Git Bash on Windows) and run:

git clone https://github.com/feseha-btc/BIOL522-NGS.git
cd BIOL522-NGS


This creates a local copy where you can add files.

2. Create the file structure

Decide what structure you want. For example, a typical course repo might look like:

BIOL522-NGS/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”œâ”€â”€ lectures/
â”œâ”€â”€ assignments/
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
â”œâ”€â”€ notebooks/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ CONTRIBUTING.md


You can create this using mkdir:

mkdir data lectures assignments scripts notebooks

3. Create the README.md file

Inside the repository folder, create README.md:

touch README.md


Then open it in a text editor (VS Code, nano, or similar) and add your content. Example template:

# BIOL522: Bioinformatics for NGS Data Analysis

This repository contains resources for the BIOL522 course:

- `data/` : Example datasets for assignments and exercises
- `lectures/` : Lecture slides and materials
- `assignments/` : Homework and problem sets
- `scripts/` : Analysis scripts and code examples
- `notebooks/` : Jupyter notebooks for hands-on exercises

4. Stage and commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add initial file structure and README.md"

5. Push to GitHub
git push origin main


After this, your repository on GitHub will show the folder structure and README.md.

ðŸ’¡ Tip: You can also create the README directly on GitHub when creating a new repo, but the above method is better for adding multiple folders at once.
